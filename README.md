# Ruben's Vim config

    This is my vim config. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

    My vim config is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. 

This is what I consider a good vim configuration. I'm not the greatest vim:
* Ninja.
* Rockstar.
* Black wizard.
* Or whatever buzzword is trendy.

But I try to make it better every now and then.

## Installation

```bash
  bash install.sh
```
